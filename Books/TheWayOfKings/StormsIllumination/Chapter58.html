          The Way of Kings Passage: I walked from Abamabar to Urithiru. In this,
          the metaphor and experience are one, inseparable to me like my mind
          and memory. One contains the other, and though I can explain one to
          you, the other is only for me. I strode this insightful distance on my
          own, and forbade attendants. I had no steed beyond my well-worn
          sandals, no companion beside a stout staf to offer conversation with
          its beats against the stone. My mouth was to be my purse; I stuffed it
          not with gems, but with song. When singing for sustenance failed me,
          my arms worked well for cleaning a floor or hogpen, and often earned
          me a satisfactory reward. Those dear to me took fright for my safety
          and, perhaps my sanity. Kings, they explained, do not walk like
          beggars for hundreds of miles. My response was that if a beggar could
          manage the feat, then why not a king? Did they think me less than
          capable than a beggar? Sometimes I think that I am. The beggar knows
          much that the king can only guess. And yet who draws up the codes for
          begging ordinances? Often I wonder what my experience in life - my
          easy life following the Desolation, and my current level of comfort -
          has given me of any true experiene to use in making laws. If we had to
          rely on what we knew, kings would only be of use in creating laws
          regarding the proper heating of tea and cushioning of thrones.
          Regardless, I made the trip and - as the astute reader has already
          concluded - survived it. The stories of its excitements will stain a
          different page in this narrative, for first I must explain my purpose
          in walking this strange path. Though I was quite willing to let my
          family think me insane, I would not leave the same as my cognonmen
          upon the winds of history. My family traveled to Urithiru via the
          direct method, and had been waiting for weeks when I arrived. I was
          not recognized at the gate, for my name had grown quite robust without
          a razor to tame it. Once I revealed myself, I was carried away,
          primped, fed, worried over, and scolded in precisely that order. Only
          after all of this was through was I finally asked the purpose of my
          excursion. Couldn't I have just taken the simple, easy, and common
          route to the holy city? For my answer, I removed my sandals and
          proffered my callused feet. They were comfortable upon the table
          beside my half-consumed tray of grapes. At this point, the expressions
          of my companions proclaimed that they thought me daft, and so I
          explained by relating the stories of my trip. One after another, like
          stacked sacks of tallew, stored for the winter season. I would make
          flatbread of them soon, then stuff it between these pages. Yes I could
          have traveled quickly. But all men have the same ultimate destination.
          Whether we find our end in a hallowed sepulcher or a pauper's ditch,
          all save the Heralds themselves must dine with the Nightwatcher.
          <br />
          And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I
          declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the
          road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is
          the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from
          carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh
          delight of experiences lived.
          <br />
          In the end, I must proclaim that no good can be achieved of false
          means. For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement,
          but in the method. The Monarch must understand this; ht must not
          become so focused on what he wishes to accomplish that he diverts his
          gaze from the path he must take to arrive there.
