        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          Wit uses the flute to tell the story of Derethil and the Wandersail.
          Derethil was a king during the shadowdays, the time before memory. A
          powerful man, commander of thousands, leader of tens of thousands.
          Tall, regal, blessed with fair skin and fairer eyes.

        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          Derethil fought the Voidbringers during the days of the Heralds and
          Radiants. Once there was peace, he commissioned the finest ship men
          have ever seen. A majestic vessel intended to do what none had dared
          before: sail the seas during a highstorm.
        </li>
        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          Derethil's goal was to seek the origins of the Voidbringers, the place
          where they spawned. Named the vessel the Wandersail. On a day when
          there was a highstorm, they cast off.
        </li>
        <li class="chapter__list-item">What did Derethil expect to find?</li>
        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          The Wandersail ran aground, but Derethil and most of his sailors
          survived, Found themselves on a ring of small islands surrounding a
          giant whirlpool, where it is said the ocean drains.
        </li>
        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          They were greeted by a strange people with long, limber bodies who
          wore robes of a single color and shells in their hair.

        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          Who are these people? They call themselves the Uvara, the People of
          the Great Abyss.

        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          A young serving girl tripped and spilled a drink, and was killed for
          her mistake. She was killed because "our emperor will not suffer
          failure." Derethil noticed more events like this.
        </li>
        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          Derethil determined that they should confront the emperor, in his
          tower on the eastern coast of the largest island

          They found that the emperor had been dead for years, as no one had

          left, and were confused why they rioted.

        <li class="chapter__list-item">
          One of the Uvara, Nafti, there caretaker and guide, was on their ship,
          when asked why, she said "Did you not see, Traveling One? If the
          emperor is dead, and has been all of these years, then the murders we
          committed are not his responsibility. They are our own."

          I have no answers for you. Most days, I feel I never have had any

          feared I'd come to rescue him again. Tell him I graduate him (Sigzil),
          he's a full Worldsinger now. Don't let him get killed. I spent far too
          long trying to force some sense into that brain of his."

          I'm taking something from you. And giving something in return. It's
          the way it used to work, though I con't remember how or when. I just
          know that it was. I am willing to stop it, if you want. But I would go
          back to being as I was before. That scares me. Floating on the wind,
          never remembering anything for longer than a few minutes. It's because
          of this tie between us that I can think again, that I can remember
          what and who I am. If we end it, I lose that."
