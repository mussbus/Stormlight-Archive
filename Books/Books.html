        Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave,
        Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a
        controversial first for a low-status "darkeyes." Now he must protect the
        king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly
        uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master
        remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the
        world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and
        elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar,
        widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role
        in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much
        deeper motives.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite
        being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible
        burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and
        the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she
        needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there
        proves more difficult than she could have imagined.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are
        making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks,
        their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader,
        Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very
        supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for
        Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous
        as they are incalculable.
